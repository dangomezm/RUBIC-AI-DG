# 🚀 Get Started

## ⚙️🔧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure the following are installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) — Used to clone the repository, manage version control, and install GEM libraries.  
  Git is typically pre-installed on macOS, but on Windows, users need to install it manually. You can verify whether Git is installed by running the following command in the terminal:
  ```bash
  git --version
  ```
- **Python 3.11**
	which can be download is not native supported in some operative system version, in those cases you can install it from python website:
	- macOS (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-macos11.pkg)
	- Windows (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.9/python-3.11.9-amd64.exe)
	
	For windows one recommend option is to use Anaconda which makes the process easier.
- **Anaconda**   
  📥 Download: [Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)  
  📖 Installation guide: [Anaconda Installation Instructions](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install#macos-linux-installation)

## 👩‍💻 Installation

1. **Create and activate virtual environment**

   **Windows (Anaconda):**
   ```bash
   conda create -n RUBIC-AI python=3.11
   conda activate RUBIC-AI
   ```

   **macOS:**
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv RUBIC-AI
   source RUBIC-AI/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```
   
   ```bash
  RUBIC-AI is not available on Linux due to some issue related to the graphical user interface.
  ```
2. **Clone the repository**

   Choose your preferred folder to clone the repository by opening the terminal and navigating to the desired location.
   ```bash
   cd /Users/your-username/Path/To/Your/Repo
   ```

    Clone the ropository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/RUBIC-AI.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **(Optional) Restart your system**

Restarting your system can help resolve potential issues related to environment path changes or incomplete installations.

> 🔁 *This step is usually not required, but recommended if you encounter errors related to newly installed dependencies.*

5. **Launch the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🕵️ Usage modes

### 1. Polygon Method 
**Best for:** Create a building stock from well defined area such as a neighborhood, city, or similar.

<a href="https://github.com/dangomezm/GEM_AI_Toolkit/tree/main/demos/polygon_method">See detailed instructions in the demos</a>


### 2. Specific Coordinates Method 
**Best for:** Characterizing specific buildings, for example: reviewing all hospitals in the area of analysis, even if they are located in different countries.

<a href="https://github.com/dangomezm/GEM_AI_Toolkit/tree/main/demos/specific_coordinates">See detailed instructions in the demos</a>

### 3. Local Images Method 

**Best for:** Create a building stock from images stored on your local device. Ideal for characterizing buildings in locations where there is no access with GSV and whose images already exist, e.g., inside a factory.

### 4. Neighbor Extrapolation

**Best for:** Expanding known building data to classify unknown buildings

## 🖥️ AI Models and Performance

### AI Models

- **Base Architectures:** DenseNet201, ConvNeXt-Tiny
- **Training Strategy:** Transfer learning from ImageNet with fine-tuning
- **Inference:** Real-time feature prediction with or without human verification.  
  > ⚠️ **Warning:**  
  > As this is the first version, we strongly recommend checking a few prediction examples to ensure the desired level of confidence in the model.  
  > However, as shown further below, these models are not perfect — they have certain accuracy limitations and perform better for specific classes and applications.
